## Important Authentication Update

Starting from the latest version, this app has updated its authentication method to use tado°'s new device code flow.
This change was required due to tado° deprecating the previous password authentication method.

### What this means for you:

1. **New Authentication Process**: When adding a new device or if your existing device needs to re-authenticate, you'll see a new login screen with a verification code.

2. **How to Authenticate**:

    - You'll be shown a verification code and a link to tado°'s website
    - Visit the link on any device (phone, tablet, computer)
    - Enter the verification code (or it may be pre-filled)
    - Login with your tado° account credentials
    - Approve the connection

3. **Existing Connections**: Your existing connections will continue to work until the tokens expire. When they do, you'll need to re-authenticate using the new method.

This change improves security while maintaining all existing functionality of the app.
